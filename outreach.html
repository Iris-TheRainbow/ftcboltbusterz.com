            <p style="font-size: 120%;">
                Our programmer is a founding member of the orginization <a href="https://unofficialrevport.org/">Unofficial REV Port</a>, a team of dedicated FTC Community members with a goal of making important software crossplatform. 
                REV Port has 3 primary projects. 
                <br><br>
                One is making the REV Hardware Client Crossplatform (and maybe eventually upstreaming to REV), which is a work in progress. 
                <br><br>
                Another was open sourcing the REV Hub Interface, which they succeeded in and now has 20 stars on github and has been downloaded more than 300 times. 
                <br><br>
                The last major project is LibREVHub, a python library that aims to extend the lifetime of the FTC control system past the 2027 control system switch by allowing REV Expansion Hubs to be used in projects with a controller other than an Android
                device.
